        <h1>App Development</h1>
        <p>
          I worked as a Developer for FreshPlay Ltd, below are a couple
          of the projects I worked on, coded in Flutter with Firebase backends.
        </p>
        <h2>Conale</h2>
        <p>Conale (short for Condition Alert) is a weather warning app where
          users can receive push notifications if the weather at a specific area
          meets a users conditions. <br><br>
          This app required integration with a client's Firebase backend with
          both Google and Apple login. As the app currently stands, I have been
          the sole developer of this project.
          <br><br>Conale is still yet to be released.

          <p>
            Flutter Series is a flutter plugin for improved row and column
            widgets with added spacing and optional interleaved dividers. This
            functionality is loosely based on Swift UI's HStack and VStack
            spacing attribute. This plugin has helped create readable code,
            reducing padding and margin headaches of widgets in rows and
            columns and has reduced unnecessary nesting.

          Music been a central figure throughout my life. Whether from

        <h2>Production</h2>
        <p>
          One of my main interests throughout my life has been music
          production. I have spent many years working on creating well
          produced music in my own time and at university. I enjoy creating a
          mixture of acoustic and electronic music, usually inspired by the
          progressive rock genre.

        <h1>Art & Design</h1>
        <p>
          Art and Design have both been passions of mine for a very long time.
          My background in painting and printing, my eye for correct proportions
          and expressive design are reflected on my development work today.

          <h2>App Design</h2>
          <p>
            Whilst working at FreshPlay Ltd and developing apps, I also
            designed apps. My eye for design carries through to my development
            practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            In all my designs I keep development in mind by creating
            responsive layouts with a high usage of Figma's components and
            auto layout. This has proven to be very useful for other
            developers to create my designs.

        <h2>Artwork</h2>
        <p>
          For my A Levels in Art & Design I created a set of lino tile prints
          based around images from the blitz in World War Two. The imagery of
          St.Paul's Cathedral still standing tall with destruction all around
          is very thought provoking. I am very proud of these pieces as a lot
          of work went into them and the results really show that.
