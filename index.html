            Brawl Quest is a 2D top down RPG where the player joins their

            fight, quests to complete and gear to be gathered. This is by far
            the largest game I have worked on, contributing to the artwork,

            Star Runner is a 2D side scrolling game where you play as a Space
            Ship that goes on an adventure, trying to gather coins and
            fighting monsters out among the asteroids whilst making sure you
            have enough fuel to get home. The game uses a combination of Box2D
            physics and resolution scaling so that the game runs on PC, tablet
            and mobile.

          <p>
            Flutter Series is a flutter plugin for improved row and column
            widgets with added spacing and optional interleaved dividers. This
            functionality is loosely based on Swift UI's HStack and VStack
            spacing attribute. This plugin has helped create readable code,
            reducing padding and margin headaches of widgets in rows and
            columns and has reduced unnecessary nesting.

        <h1>Music</h1>
        <p>
          Music been a central figure throughout my life. Whether from
          production, programming or performance, I have always loved playing
          and pushing the boundaries of my musical ability.
        </p>
        <h2>Production</h2>
        <p>
          One of my main interests throughout my life has been music
          production. I have spent many years working on creating well
          produced music in my own time and at university. I enjoy creating a
          mixture of acoustic and electronic music, usually inspired by the
          progressive rock genre.

          average length of one minute to highlight how modern streaming
          services are effecting the music industry as a whole. With the advent

        <h1>Art & Design</h1>
        <p>
          Art and Design have both been passions of mine for a very long time.
          My background in painting and printing, my eye for correct proportions
          and expressive design are reflected on my development work today.

          <h2>App Design</h2>
          <p>
            Whilst working at FreshPlay Ltd and developing apps, I also
            designed apps. My eye for design carries through to my development
            practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            In all my designs I keep development in mind by creating
            responsive layouts with a high usage of Figma's components and
            auto layout. This has proven to be very useful for other
            developers to create my designs.

        <h2>Artwork</h2>
        <p>
          For my A Levels in Art & Design I created a set of lino tile prints
          based around images from the blitz in World War Two. The imagery of
          St.Paul's Cathedral still standing tall with destruction all around
          is very thought provoking. I am very proud of these pieces as a lot
          of work went into them and the results really show that.
