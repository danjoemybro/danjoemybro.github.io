          <h3>Hi! Why are you not working?</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a Flutter developer from Colchester with a background in
            <strong>music</strong>, <strong>art</strong>
            and
            <strong>design</strong>. My skills in Flutter were honed at Fresh
            Play Ltd, where I both designed and coded apps for clients - using
            my artistic skills and keen eye for detail to create high quality
            apps. I am a fast learner, always eager to find new ways to solve
            problems and broaden my knowledge of new aspects of development. I
            also have a good understanding of the pitfalls that can occur in
            the full-stack of development and the importance of clear and
            timely communication between colleagues; whether through face to
            face interaction or well commented code.

            Brawl Quest is a 2D top down RPG where the player joins their
            friends, exploring a magical world where there are monsters to
            fight, quests to complete and gear to be gathered. This is by far
            the largest game I have worked on, contributing to the artwork,
            code and even music.

          <p>
            Star Runner is a 2D side scrolling game where you play as a Space
            Ship that goes on an adventure, trying to gather coins and
            fighting monsters out among the asteroids whilst making sure you
            have enough fuel to get home. The game uses a combination of Box2D
            physics and resolution scaling so that the game runs on PC, tablet
            and mobile.

          <p>
            Flutter Series is a flutter plugin for improved row and column
            widgets with added spacing and optional interleaved dividers. This
            functionality is loosely based on Swift UI's HStack and VStack
            spacing attribute. This plugin has helped create readable code,
            reducing padding and margin headaches of widgets in rows and
            columns and has reduced unnecessary nesting.

        <h1>Music</h1>
        <p>
          Music been a central figure throughout my life. Whether from
          production, programming or performance, I have always loved playing
          and pushing the boundaries of my musical ability.
        </p>
        <h2>Production</h2>
        <p>
          One of my main interests throughout my life has been music
          production. I have spent many years working on creating well
          produced music in my own time, and then at University.
